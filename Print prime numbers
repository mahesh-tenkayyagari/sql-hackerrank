Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000.Print your result on a single line, 
and use the ampersand(&) character as your separator (instead of a space).
For example, the output for all prime numbers <=10 would be:-
2&3&5&7

WITH SEQ AS 
(
SELECT
LEVEL LVL
FROM
DUAL A
CONNECT BY LEVEL<=1000
)

SELECT
LISTAGG(LVL,'&') WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY LVL) AS TXT
FROM
(
SELECT
A.LVL
FROM
SEQ A
WHERE 
A.LVL>1 AND
NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM SEQ B WHERE B.LVL>1 AND B.LVL<A.LVL AND MOD(A.LVL,B.LVL)=0)
);
